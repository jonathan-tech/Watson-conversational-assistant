# Counciler-Conversational-Assistant

### For this project I built a conversational assistant for Hudson County Community College. I specifically created the assistant that could help a student make an appointment to see  a counselor at either the North Hudson Campus or the Main Campus. This assistant also gives directions to the counselor that the user chooses and allows the user to cancel appointments as well.


## Functionality
When the user opens the WeatherApp, a page will display with an empty input box and a button that reads "Add City". By submiting a City, the Python Script will call the OpenWeatherMap API and grab the Degrees, Description and Icon of that City. If Successful the City will show up at the bottom of the screen with the data that was grabed. The user can delete the City from the list if he or she wishes
