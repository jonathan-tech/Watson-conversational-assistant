# Counciler-Conversational-Assistant

### This project was an assignment for my Operating systems class. I built a conversational assistant for Hudson County Community College. I created an assistant that could help a student make an appointment to see  a counselor at either the North Hudson Campus or the Main Campus. This assistant also gives directions to the counselor that the user chooses and allows the user to cancel appointments as well.

## Functionality
When the user opens the link, a page will display with a greeting and explain what the assistant can help you with. If you make you decide to make an appointment then the assistant will ask the user a series of questions to complete the application. The user can also as for the directions to the conciler and ask to cancel an appointment
