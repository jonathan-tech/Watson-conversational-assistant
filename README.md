# Counciler-Conversational-Assistant

### This project was an assignment for my Operating systems class. I built a conversational assistant powered with A.I, for Hudson County Community College. I created an assistant that could help a students make an appointment to see a counselor at either the North Hudson Campus or the Main Campus. This assistant also gives directions to the counselor that the user chooses and allows the user to cancel appointments as well. Docmuments are avalible opon request.

## Functionality
When the user opens the link, a page will display with a greeting and explain what the assistant can help the user with. If the users decides to make an appointment then the assistant will ask the user a series of questions to complete the application. The user can also as for the directions to the conciler and ask to cancel an appointment. 

## What I learned
- Incorporating A.I to a project
- Incorporating Intents and Entities into a diolog flow
